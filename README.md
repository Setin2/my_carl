# Carla RL

Generic offline actor-critic in the CARLA simulator

## Description

An implementation of the offline version of the generic AC algorithm as described in S. Levine, A. Kumar, G. Tucker, and J. Fu, "Offline reinforcement learning:
Tutorial, review, and perspectives on open problems". Results are unsatisfying and the offline version of the algorithm is not suited for the problem.

NB: the files of rewards and obs/states are switched
